# TARS Solar System Visualization

This is an orbital mechanics simulation and a visualization of the TARS (Torqued Accelerator using Radiation from the Sun) concept, based on the paper "[Torqued Accelerator using Radiation from the Sun (TARS) for Interstellar Payloads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17615)".

## Disclaimer

Mostly build-by AI

This is a work in progress. The simulation is not yet a complete or fully accurate representation. The physics modeling is currently under construction.
